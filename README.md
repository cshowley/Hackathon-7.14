# Hackathon-7.14

Running the script will generate 3 plots:
  1) The baseline model for bandwidth usage over a 24 hour period
  2) On top of the baseline, randomly distributed amounts of data in addition to the baseline
  3) A reordered version of plot (2) that sorts the randomized data to create a lower peak than in the original plot
  
These are simulated results of a browser extension download manager that controls when a given user's files are downloaded.
